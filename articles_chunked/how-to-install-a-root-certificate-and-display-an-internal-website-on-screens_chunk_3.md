Topic: How To Install A Root Certificate And Display An Internal Website On Screens

## Installing a Root Certificate on a Windows Device

Broadly, there are four major steps to installing a root certificate locally on a Windows device:

1. Open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC)
2. Add the Certificates Snap-In
3. Import the Certificate
4. Verify the Installation

These same steps can be performed quickly using the Windows Terminal, if you’re so inclined.

Be cautious when installing root certificates, especially self-signed ones. Only install certificates from sources you trust completely.

### Open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC)

The first step is opening the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), which is a framework for managing Windows components.

To do this, click **Start,** type **mmc** into the Search bar, then press **Enter**.

With the MMC open, go to **File → Add/Remove Snap-In**.

In the “Available snap-ins” list, select **Certificates** and click **Add.**

Next, click **Local computer** and click **Finish**.

Click **OK** to close the “Add or Remove Snap-ins” dialog.

### Import the Certificate

Now **Certificates (Local Computer)** will appear as an option in your MMC. To continue, expand the **Certificates (Local Computer)** option within the right pane of the console. Then, expand **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**.

Right-click on the **Certificates** folder and select **All Tasks → Import**.

This will open the Certificate Import Wizard. Click **Next** to get started.

Now, click **Browse.** Locate your self-signed certificate and select it. This should be a .pem file. You may need to expand the file name options to **All Files** to see it.

Select the file and click **Open → Next.**

Select **Place all certificates in the following store.** Ensure that **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** is selected, then click **Next.**

Now you’ll be asked to confirm whether you want to complete the import. As long as you trust the certificate, agree to it by hitting **Finish**.

### Verify the Installation

Close the MMC.

Open a web browser and try accessing the local host domain. If the certificate is installed correctly, you should no longer see the security warning. However, because it's a self-signed root certificate, you might still see a warning indicating that the website's identity cannot be verified.

If you encounter any issues, double-check the file paths, file names, and the output of the Certificate Import Wizard for any error messages.

### Command Line Installation

You can also use the **Terminal** to directly install the certificate. Simply open up the Terminal app with Administrator privileges after searching for it on your Start bar, and input the following command:

```
certutil –addstore –f "Root" “C:\path\to\your_certificate_file”
```

This will automatically install the certificate to the Trusted Root Certificates folder and you should be able to access the host domain in the same way as above.
