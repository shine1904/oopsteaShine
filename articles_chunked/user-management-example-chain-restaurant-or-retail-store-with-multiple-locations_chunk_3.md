## Creating Teams

Before we can do that, we’ll need to set up our Teams. Teams act like a bucket where users can be assigned based on the level of permissions we want them to have. With our folders set up, it becomes easier to see what Teams we’ll want to create, but you can also start with this step and set up the folders later. For more information, see our article on **Teams and Security Levels** (https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034883113-Working-with-Teams-and-Security-Levels).

In this example, we’ll want to create a Team for each store location. In addition, we’ll want to set up a Team for any managers of the Los Angeles City/Subregion; California state; and Pacific Region. We’ll then use Folder permissions to restrict access to each nested folder to the appropriate Team. By doing this, only the Account Owner and Super Admins will have access to the full structure.

| **IMPORTANT NOTE** |
| For increased centralization, you can remove Teams at various levels. If you want a 100% centrally managed system with no input outside your IT department, you can skip this step entirely. OptiSigns is extremely flexible and can be configured to any structure you like. |

To get started, go to **Account Members** under your user profile.

!access account members for teams creation (https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43657783477523)

You’ll see the **Default Team**, which for now should only consist of the Account Owner. The Default Team is typically reserved for central management, and people within this team will be able to see the entire organizational structure. In this example, our Default Team will represent the national level, able to view all screens across our company. They will also be responsible for adding any new screens and moving them between teams as needed.

To continue, click **Add Team**.

!default team and add team (https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43657783478291)

The following screen will appear:

!add team screen with info filled in (https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43657735756179)

Here, we’ve named the team after the region, which will be managing all screens in the region. We’ve also written a short description of the team's purpose. We’ll set up the “Number of screens limit” later, once all our screens are set up.

| **IMPORTANT NOTE** |
| There are no such things as “Sub-Teams” in OptiSigns. While it is possible to provide regional managers (in our example) access to all the screens or content under their purview, they WILL NOT be able to manage their users in kind. This can only be done by Super Admins, who can manage Users across teams. Set up your teams accordingly. |

Now we’ll proceed to create all our Teams. A basic setup might look something like this:

!teams setup with admins and users (https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43657735756435)  
A bit about User Roles before we continue:

* **Owner / Super Admin** -Have full access to all teams. Can create teams and access billing. Capable of inviting users to teams, managing all screens, and resetting passwords across multiple teams.
* **Admin** - Has full access to an individual team. Can invite users to the team, manage the number of screens available per team, and reset passwords for other users.
* **User** - Can create, edit, and delete all content within the folders they have access to. Can add or remove screens.

The others, we don’t need to worry about for this example. For more on User Roles, see our article on **Managing User Roles** (https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046356113-Advanced-Security-Managing-User-Roles).

For this example, we’ve given Admin access to all our regional and local managers, as well as the store manager. A User has been added to the store as well, who will be able to add content and edit the screens only within that store.

| **NOTE** |
| If you plan to add Users to the platform via SSO, you may skip this step. We’ve created the users above for demonstration purposes. |

Finally, ***Refresh your browser***. You’ll need to do this before the next step.
